Optimized for lower gas during batch mints.\n *\n * Token IDs are minted in sequential order (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)\n * starting from `_startTokenId()`.\n *\n * The `_sequentialUpTo()` function can be overriden to enable spot mints\n * (i.e. non-consecutive mints) for `tokenId`s greater than `_sequentialUpTo()`.\n *\n * Assumptions:\n *\n * - An owner cannot have more than 2**64 - 1 (max value of uint64) of supply.\n * - The maximum token ID cannot exceed 2**256 - 1 (max value of uint256).\n */\ncontract ERC721A is IERC721A {\n    // Bypass for a `--via-ir` bug
